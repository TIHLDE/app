# App
App for linjeforeningen.

### Basic info
This website uses the following technologies

* Yarn (Package-manager)
* React Native
* Expo

### Getting started

#### Installing
This project uses yarn, so all you have to do is to clone, install and run.

```
git clone git@github.com:tihlde/App.git
cd App
yarn install
yarn start 
```

### Rules
These rules are to be updated

* The main _/components_ folder should only contain DUMMY-COMPONENTS. These components are shared between
all the different pages, and should not implement page-specific logic. The components should be so dumb
they can be moved to a different project and still work.
* All screens should be placed in the _/screens_.
